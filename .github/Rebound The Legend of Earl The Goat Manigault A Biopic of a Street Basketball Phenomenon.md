The film follows Manigault's life from his childhood in Harlem, where he earned his nickname "The Goat" (which stands for Greatest Of All Time) by dominating the playgrounds and winning tournaments. He was recruited by a prestigious high school, but dropped out after being suspended for skipping classes. He then became addicted to heroin and spent time in prison, where he met Dr. McDuffie, who encouraged him to turn his life around. After being released, Manigault dedicated himself to helping the young kids of Harlem by organizing basketball clinics and tournaments. He also tried to make a comeback in the professional leagues, but was hindered by his age and health problems.
  
The film is based on factual events and interviews with people who knew Manigault, such as his former teammates, coaches, friends, and rivals. It portrays Manigault as a complex and flawed person, who had a passion for basketball but also struggled with personal demons. It also shows the social and cultural context of Harlem in the 1960s and 1970s, where basketball was a way of expression and escape for many young black men.
  
Rebound: The Legend of Earl "The Goat" Manigault is a tribute to one of the most talented and influential basketball players who never made it to the NBA, but whose legend lives on in the streets and courts of Harlem. It is a film that celebrates the spirit of basketball and the power of redemption.

However, Manigault's basketball career was derailed by his addiction to heroin, which he started using when he was 19 years old. He dropped out of college after one semester and spent most of his time on the streets of Harlem, hustling and getting high. He was arrested several times for drug-related offenses and served two prison terms, one in 1969 and another in 1977. He also contracted hepatitis C from sharing needles.
  
Despite his personal troubles, Manigault still played basketball occasionally and amazed crowds with his skills. He also tried to give back to his community by organizing basketball clinics and tournaments for the youth of Harlem. In 1977, he founded the Goat Tournament, an annual event that attracted hundreds of players and spectators. He also worked as a counselor and mentor for Supportive Children's Advocacy Network, a nonprofit organization that helps troubled kids.
  
Manigault's life story was dramatized in two films: Rebound: The Legend of Earl "The Goat" Manigault (1996), a HBO movie starring Don Cheadle as Manigault; and The Goat (2009), an independent film directed by Alfredo Rates. Both films portrayed Manigault as a tragic figure who wasted his talent and potential but also tried to redeem himself by helping others.
  
Manigault died on May 15, 1998, at the age of 53, from heart failure caused by his chronic drug abuse. He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. His legacy lives on in the memories of those who saw him play and in the legends that surround him. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players who never made it to the NBA, but whose influence can be seen in many of today's stars.
